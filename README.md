# Deep Q Networks in tensorflow

This is a side project to learn more about reinforcement learning. The goal is to have a relatively simple implementation of Deep Q Networks that can learn on (some) of the Atari Games. 

## Tricks used
* Double DQN
* Loss clipping
* Andrej Karpathy's pre-processing

## Learning on the Pong environment
Requires about 8 hours on a NVidia Titan X


## Limitations
The code is only tested on CartPole-v0, CartPole-v1, AcroBot-V0, Pong-v0


## Dependencies
* Tensorflow 1.0
* OpenAI gym
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
